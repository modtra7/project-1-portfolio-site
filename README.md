My Portfolio Site

-steps-

1. setup html and establish each page and the content for it
    -used divs to create my structure
    -creating classes and ids for planning and mapping

2. start css to seperate each section visually
    -size each pages content and organize

3. created js interaction points

4. additional css with media queries for responsive design

    this was an interesting experience and though this process i have a better understanding of css and utilizing flex.

    as i worked i notice many different ways to go about creating what you need and it helped me with my thinking of how i would want to go about doing certain things

    there are some things i'd add or change and i have new ideas thst i would like to implement when recreating a website.
